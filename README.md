# [Project 1: Carbon Free Energy(2019-2021)](https://dataanalystsolz.github.io/Adesola-s-portfolio/)

This project is what i did personally in order to attract potential job opportunitues in the field of data analytics in order to showcase my skills so far

For this second project:
* Data was pulled from the carbon free energy public dataset in BigQuery
* I used basic SQL queries to filter the dataset to get the information I required
* I exported the results to spreadsheet file and converted the file from csv. to xlsx. format
* SQL file link: https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=40601236445:9255ca5380ed4809a64b60c756c46972

Data visualizations which shows the carbon free energy (the energy is produced by a resource that generates no carbon emissions, such as nuclear or large hydroelectric.) from different locations across the world within each year were also created

During my analysis, it was discovered that carbon free energy increases with each following year and North America has highest carbon free energy compared to Asia,Europe,Australia and South America because North America has locations with more carbon-free energy(such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, solar) facilities than any of the locations within each of the aforementioned continents.
